# Developing
This repo uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/overview) and [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) to create a reactive static website that can interface with our FastAPI backend.

> [!NOTE]
> This project uses Svelte, a JavaScript framework that compiles declarative UI components into efficient JavaScript code. SvelteKit is used to provide file-based routing, server-side rendering, and static site generation, as well as development tooling and project structure. Together, they allow us to build the web application as a set of modular components with clear routing and deployment options.
>
> This repo uses Svelte 5 with runes.
